        <!-- The theme that I chose to focus on was the Big Island of Hawaii, and helping the 
            viewer explore things to do while on the island. I pretended to have my own tour company, 
            in which I am selling excursion packages; the most fun I had when in Hawaii was during the excursions
            I took on the island. I wanted to "market" two different types of excursions, and do a play 
            off of ones that I had taken with my family. Additionally, when I went to the Big Island, I wanted to know
            what beaches were the best to go to, since there were so many I could choose from. I provided 
            a section on my website where I share my favorite beaches that I visited, in hopes that the 
            viewer might go there during their trip.-->
